## Challenge Analysis

Oversampling
 
•	Precision value of 99% means that 1 of every 100 loans is risky loan.
•	Recall value is 71 % means that about 30 of every 100 loans in reality are missed by this model.
•	Specificity value of 72% means that about 32 of every 100 loans in reality are miss-labeled as risky loans.
•	F1 score of 82% indicates this model predicts 82 loans accurately for every 100 loans.
SMOTE Oversampling
 
•	Precision value of 99% means that 1 of every 100 loans is risky loan.
•	Recall value is 70 % means that about 30 of every 100 loans in reality are missed by this model.
•	Specificity value of 70% means that about 30 of every 100 loans in reality are miss-labeled as risky loans.
•	F1 score of 82% indicates this model predicts 82 loans accurately for every 100 loans.
UnderSampling
 
•	Precision value of 99% means that 1 of every 100 loans is risky loan.
•	Recall value is 48 % means that about 50 of every 100 loans in reality are missed by this model.
•	Specificity value of 81% means that about 20 of every 100 loans in reality are miss-labeled as risky loans.
•	F1 score of 64% indicates this model predicts 64 loans accurately for every 100 loans.
Combination (Over and Under) Sampling
 
•	Precision value of 99% means that 1 of every 100 loans is risky loan.
•	Recall value is 68 % means that about 68 of every 100 loans in reality are missed by this model.
•	Specificity value of 71% means that about 31 of every 100 loans in reality are miss-labeled as risky loans.
•	F1 score of 81% indicates this model predicts 81 loans accurately for every 100 loans.


SMOTE or Oversampling does better prediction in this example than Undersampling of combination model.
